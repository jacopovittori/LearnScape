# LearnScape

**LearnScape** is a web-based platform designed to radically transform how we study and learn. It integrates AI-driven guidance, interactive tools, and gamified workflows to make learning more immersive, meaningful, and aligned with how the human brain actually learns.

## Overview

LearnScape addresses one of the core limitations of traditional education: the lack of cognitive engagement. Neuroscientific evidence shows that the human brain did not evolve to study abstractly or passively. LearnScape rethinks the educational experience to better align with natural cognitive processesâ€”by making learning active, playful, and supported by technology.

Unlike generic tools like Notion, Anki, or ChatGPT, LearnScape is purpose-built for studying. It offers a structured, research-informed environment that enhances learning performance through the synergy of AI feedback, content reworking, personalized repetition, and visual organization of knowledge.

In its first version, LearnScape does not use AI to replace the studentâ€™s cognitive effort, but to **support it**, much like a coach or a responsive tutor would.

## Core Features (MVP)

The MVP focuses on a minimal but essential set of features:

- **Upload and Parse Learning Material**  
  Upload documents (PDFs, text, audio) and have them analyzed for key points and structure.

- **Generate Learning Resources (with AI feedback)**  
  Create summaries, flashcards, quizzes and exercisesâ€”either manually, with AI support, or through automatic generation (depending on available LearnCredits).

- **Earn and Spend LearnCredits**  
  Students earn credits by crafting their own resources (summaries, cards, questions). These can be exchanged for AI-generated content to encourage active elaboration over passive consumption.

- **Organize Material by Purpose**  
  Every file or group of files is organized by function:  
  - **Primary resources** (original documents)  
  - **Supporting material** (AI-aided or user-generated elaboration)  
  - **Review resources** (cards, quizzes, exercises)  
  - **Advanced enrichment** (optional deep dives)  
  - **Evaluation space** (performance tracking)

- **Personalized Review System**  
  Based on spaced repetition, AI-generated feedback, and user progress, the platform suggests what and when to review, targeting weak points dynamically.

- **Gamified Progress Tracking**  
  XP points are earned based on consistency and depth of engagement within a subject. Visual graphs show mastery level and review frequency.

## Target Audience

- High school and university students
- Lifelong learners seeking structure and engagement
- Anyone aiming to improve cognitive depth, memory, or autonomy in learning

## Vision

In the long term, LearnScape will evolve into a fully immersive learning experience that merges traditional UI with 3D game-like environments. Users will interact with their own avatar, complete missions, collaborate on simulations, and build knowledge ecosystems driven by curiosity, challenge and creativity. AI will continue to play a scaffolding roleâ€”never replacing the learner, but empowering them.

LearnScape aims to make education feel more like exploration than obligation.

## Current Status

> LearnScape is in its early development stage.  
The repository has been initialized, with the first HTML/CSS interfaces developed for user login and sign-up. Frontend and backend development are in progress. The first usable version is targeted within the next 1.5â€“2 months.

## Team

- **Jacopo Vittori** â€” Vision lead, frontend developer, product strategist  
- **Kevin Shytaj** â€” Backend developer, systems architecture and integration

We are a self-managed, independent team with a startup-like methodology, though not incorporated. The project is experimental, science-based, and mission-driven.
